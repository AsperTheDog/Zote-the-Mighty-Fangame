# Zote-the-Mighty-Fangame
This repository is an archive of the ongoing fangame project made by Guillermo Muñoz and Raúl Martín. It is not the active development repository as that one is private.

## Important notice
Since we use several propietary assets in this project we are not able to upload it completely, which means several tools and assets are missing in this version of the projects. Most of the project is broken without them.
