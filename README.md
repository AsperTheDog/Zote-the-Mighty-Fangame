# Zote-the-Mighty-Fangame
This repository is an archive of the fangame project made by [Guillermo Muñoz](https://github.com/AsperTheDog) and [Raúl Martín](https://github.com/626raul626). It is not the active development repository as that one is private.
This project has been discontinued as we have moved on to making our own independent games.

## Important notice
Since we use several propietary assets in this project we are not able to upload it completely, which means several tools and assets are missing in this repository. Most of the project is broken without them. **This repository is not made to be downloaded and played**
